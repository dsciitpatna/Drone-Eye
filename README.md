# Drone-Eye
A drone project that performs object detection and make a search engine out of the drone feed.  Project under Machine Learning and AI society of **Developer Students Club - IIT Patna**.

## Motivation
Modern drones are be equipped with cameras and are very prospective for a variety of commercial uses such as aerial photography, surveillance, etc.n. However, there are more challenges with drones due to top-down view angles and real-time constraints. Additionally, a challenging problem is the strong weight and area constraint of embedded hardware that limits the drones to run computation intensive algorithms, such as deep learning, with limited hardware resource.

## Aim
Drone-Eye is a framework that intends to tackle both problems while running on embedded systems that can be mounted onto drones.Deep neural networks, object detection and object searching are the three major components in our work.

## Prerequisites
1. Basic Deep Learning concepts.
2. Basics of Convolutional Neural Networks.
3. Object Detection using CNN
4. Tools
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org)
* [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [Keras](https://keras.io/)
* Basic python libraries used in ML ([Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)).

## Resources
To be added later on.

## Further Works
Further we may deploy the model and make search engine out of the feed collected from camera.
